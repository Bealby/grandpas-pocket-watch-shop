[Unit Tests](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/)
Django comes with a test suite of `Unit Tests` that all use the
testing infrastructure that ships with Django for testing applications.

A variety of standard unit tests were carried for test_forms.py
and test_views.py. However a more expansive test program, which
would include tests on models, would be beneficial and should be
carried out if more resource time was available.

### User Experience

[User Stories](#user-stories).

## Fixes

- For Web pages with `Crispy-Forms` it was found that when loading
  the Web page on mobile devices the page load to the section of
  the Crispy Form rather than top of the page.

  To fix this the onload command, `<body onLoad="window.scroll(0, 0)">`,
  was used in the `Body` of base.html to ensure all pages loading to
  section at top of page.

- It was important to have a `Date Picker` for the services form so
  that a user can pick a date and time with a calendar that is formatted
  with specific date options.

  Calibrating a `Date Picker` with good UI and UX became an issue with
  UI of the Date Picker being very un user friendly with the time aspect
  needing to be chosen as well as the date.

  It was therefore decided to create a separate model for 'Time'
  with the two options of 09:00 and 12:00. Allowing for a better
  user experience for the user when picking a date.

- While committing changes there was an error which caused the env.py
  with Stripe and Google Map secret keys being exposed in the commits
  in GitHub. 
  
  Due to this all secret keys were updated and the old secret keys
  being made rendundant.env.py file.
