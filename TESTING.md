[Unit Tests](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/)
Django comes with a test suite of `Unit Tests` that all use the
testing infrastructure that ships with Django for testing applications.

A variaty of standard unit tests were carried for test_forms.py
and test_views.py. However a more expansive test program, which
would incude tests on models, would be beneficial and should be
carried out if more resource time was available.
