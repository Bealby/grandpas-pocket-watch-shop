# Grandpa's Pocket Watch Shop

---

Pocket Watches can be traced back to the late 15th century
in Italy, with manufacture spreading throughout the rest of
Europe in the early part of the 16th century. They were
the most common type of watch until around 1914 when wrist
watches started to come into fashion. 
    
Although their professional usage in the modern environment
has come to an end they still hold a lot of value and
attraction for enthusiasts who enjoy both the pleasure of
owning a pocket watch and fixing and refurbishing
one.

Although a niche market the value of **Pocket Watches**,
**Parts** and **Tools** can be highly sought after and
highly valued. (Further text: Intricate parts of watches.

**Pocket Watches**, **Parts** and **Tools**. To fill the gap
in the market of a modern e-commerce Website that paves the way
for a smooth, easy and friendly place for consumers to search,
view and purchase **Pocket Watches**, **Parts** and **Tools**.

## UX

---

### Strategy

Users of this Website are a specific group of pocket
watch enthusiasts who often have a high level of knowledge
with particular pocket watch requirements. The Website
therefore needs to be fully researched and accurately
describe it's products.

For most e-commerce Websites the aims of the user is to
be able to quickly navigate to the product they require with
ease and intuition, and with limited complications. Adding a
'Search' feature to the Website will increase users ability
to find products in a quicker way.

The Website needs to stand out from it's competitors by being
rich in imagery and specific in product details. Creating a Forum
for registered users to ask questions and share information, will
draw users together and entice them to continue to return to the
Website.

A mobile first approach will be instigated in the design
to allow users to purchase easily and efficiently on smaller
devices. 

For this Website an 'Agile User Stories' list will
continually be assessed and achieved to ensure the greatest
experience and satisfaction for users.

Agile User Stories can be found
[here](https://github.com/Bealby/grandpas-pocket-watch-shop/blob/master/documentation/readme/user-stories.pdf)

### Scope

The Website needs to allow users to add products to their
basket on a continues basis while shopping and perusing through
the Website. For them to penultimately follow through to the checkout
and payment, while being notified of each step along the way.

The Website also needs to allow it's 'superusers' to create, edit
and delete products to accurately maintain details and expand the
Website's product portfolio. 

A contact information page to allow users to make enquiries
regarding products and purchases will also be provided.
Along with a Q&A Forum that registered users can use.

### Structure

As an e-commerce enterprise that sells products, the
Website needs to reflect this visably upon entering
the Website, so that users know exactly why they are 'there', 
and what they can immediately 'do'.

To achieve this goal, e-commerce design conventions need
to be applied, with strong brands such as 'Amazon', 'Ebay' and
'Etsy', being closely researched and conformed to accordingly.

The **Navigation Bar** will be fixed at the top along with the
**Logo**, **Search Bar** stretched acorss the centre. **Product** headers will be displayed
underneath and centered. **Icons** will be used for the
**Login** and **Basket** features that will be positioned to the
far right of the **Navigation Bar**. 

The main **Home** page will have a bold heading titled "Start 
Shopping" with an arrow pointing downwards to three images of
a 'Pocket Watch', 'Parts' and 'Tools'. These images should
intuitiviely convey the Website's aim of selling these types of
products. 

The placement of imagery and icons, as well as the structure of the
navigation bar and home page, should help horn and focus users
intuition into buying. The key factor being that the simple,
concise structure will not cause cognitive overload and
distract the main aim of the Website. 

Throughout the Website a strong emphasis will be made on 
clear imagery of products, ensuring that product layout does
not come across as congested. This will allow users to view and search
products quickly and efficiently. Expedited their desire to
add products to their basket and check out with comlete ease. 

Extra features such as links to `About`, `Contact` and `Q&A Forum`
will be displayed in the footer of the Web page. This limits the users
attention to being drawn to other parts of the Website rather than
shopping. 

Links to `About`, `Contact` and `Q&A Forum` will not however
become obsolete as the longer the user is enagged in the
Website the more likey their trust will grow. Leading users to
naturally to search and find links to `About`, `Contact` and `Q&A Forum`
as tried and tested results have proven in current e-coomerce Websites.
