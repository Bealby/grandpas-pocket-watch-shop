# Grandpa's Pocket Watch Shop

Pocket Watches can be traced back to the late 15th century in Italy, 
with manufacture spreading throughout the rest of Europe in the early
part of the 16th century. They were the most common type of watch until
around 1914 when wrist watches started to come into fashion. 
    
Although their professional usage in the modern environment has come to an
end they still hold a lot of value and attraction for enthusiasts who 
enjoy both the pleasure of owning one as well as fixing and refurbishing
them.

Although a niche market the value of Pocket watches and parts can be
highly sought after and highly valued.

The aim of this Website is to provide an outlet for 'Pocket Watches',
'Parts' and 'Tools'. To fill the gap in the market of a modern e-commerce
Website that paves the way for a smooth, easy and friendly place for
consumers to search, view and purchase
Pocket Watches, Parts and Tools.

## UX

---

### Strategy

The main focus of this Website is for the adventurous who are
looking for a new exciting hobbie to participate in and share
their finds with their local community. The Website
will enable participants to create, read, update and delete (CRUD),
their Magnet Fishing catches.

The Website needs to be efficient on mobile devices, as well
as functional and easy to use. This will allow participants to share
finds while out Magnet Fishing in Stockholm. The data needs to
be displayed concisely and clearly, with the ability to engage
in CRUD operations out in the field.

The desktop and tablet versions will provide a more visual
and expansive user experience that can be used in a
more comfortable environment after a long day Magnet Fishing.
