# Grandpa's Pocket Watch Shop

---

Pocket Watches can be traced back to the late 15th century
in Italy, with manufacture spreading throughout the rest of
Europe in the early part of the 16th century. They were
the most common type of watch until around 1914 when wrist
watches started to come into fashion. 
    
Although their professional usage in the modern environment
has come to an end they still hold a lot of value and
attraction for enthusiasts who enjoy both the pleasure of
owning a pocket watch and fixing and refurbishing
one.

Although a niche market the value of **pocket watches**,
**parts** and **tools** can be highly sought after and
highly valued.

The aim of this Website is to provide an outlet for
**Pocket Watches**, **Parts** and **Tools**. To fill the gap
in the market of a modern e-commerce Website that paves the way
for a smooth, easy and friendly place for consumers to search,
view and purchase **Pocket Watches**, **Parts** and **Tools**.

## UX

---

### Strategy

Users of this Website are a specific group of pocket
watch enthusiasts who often have a high level of knowledge
with particular pocket watch requirements. The Website
therefore needs to be fully researched and accurately
describe it's products.

For most e-commerce Websites the aims of the user is to
be able to quickly navigate to the product they require with
ease and intuition, and with limited complications. Adding a
'Search' feature to the Website will increase users ability
to find products in a quicker way.

The Website needs to stand out from it's competitors by being
rich in imagery and specific in product details. Creating a Forum
for registered users to ask questions and share information, will
draw users together and entice them to continue to return to the
Website.

A mobile first approach will be instigated in the design
to allow users to purchase easily and efficiently on smaller
devices. 

For this Website an 'Agile User Stories' list will
continually be assessed and achieved to ensure the greatest
experience and satisfaction for users.

Agile User Stories can be found

### Scope

The Website needs to allow users to add products to their
basket on a continues basis while shopping and perusing through
the Website. To then penultimately follow through to the checkout
and payment, while being notified of each step along the way.

The Website also needs to allow it's superusers to create, edit
and delete products to accurately detail and expand the Website's
product portfolio. 

The final scope of the website needs to include contact information
for users to send emails with any follow up purchase enquiries. 

Communication options will be expanded further to a Q&A Forum that
can be accessed by registered users.

### Structure
