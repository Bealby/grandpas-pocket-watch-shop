# Grandpa's Pocket Watch Shop

---

Pocket Watches can be traced back to the late 15th century
in Italy, with manufacture spreading throughout the rest of
Europe in the early part of the 16th century. They were
the most common type of watch until around 1914 when wrist
watches started to come into fashion.

Although their professional usage in the modern environment
has come to an end they still hold a lot of value and
attraction for enthusiasts who enjoy both the pleasure of
owning a pocket watch and fixing and refurbishing
one.

Although a niche market the value of **Pocket Watches**,
**Parts** and **Tools** can be highly sought after and
highly valued. However, such intricate parts can be very
difficult to come by and find, which is why a website is
a perfect platform to fill this gap in the market place.

The aim of this Website is to provide an outlet for
**Pocket Watches**, **Parts** and **Tools**. To fill the gap
in the market of a modern e-commerce Website that paves the way
for a smooth, easy and friendly place for consumers to search,
view and purchase **Pocket Watches**, **Parts** and **Tools**.

## UX

---

### Strategy

Users of this Website are a specific group of pocket
watch enthusiasts who often have a high level of knowledge
with particular pocket watch requirements and needs. The Website
therefore needs to be fully researched and accurately
describe it's products.

For most e-commerce Websites the aims of the user is to
be able to quickly navigate to the product they require with
ease, intuition, and limited complications. Adding a
'Search' feature to the Website will increase users ability
to find products in a quicker way.

The Website needs to stand out from it's competitors by being
rich in imagery and specific in product details. Creating a repair
or valuation service for registered users only will increase user
loyalty to the Website and encourage them to return.

A mobile first approach will be instigated in the design
to allow users to purchase easily and efficiently on smaller
devices.

For this Website an 'Agile User Stories' list will
continually be assessed and achieved to ensure the greatest
experience and satisfaction for users.

Agile User Stories can be found
[here](https://github.com/Bealby/grandpas-pocket-watch-shop/blob/master/documentation/readme/user-stories.pdf)

### Scope

The Website needs to allow users to add products to their
basket on a continuous basis while shopping and perusing through
the Website. To penultimately follow through to the checkout
and payment, while being notified of each step along the way.

The Website also needs to allow it's 'superusers' to create, edit
and delete products to accurately maintain details and expand the
Website's product portfolio.

A contact information page to allow users to make enquiries
regarding products and purchases will also be provided.
Along with a repair and valuation service,

### Structure

As an e-commerce enterprise that sells products, the
Website needs to reflect this visibly upon entering
the Website, so that users know exactly why they are 'there',
and what they can immediately 'do'.

To achieve this goal, e-commerce design conventions need
to be applied, with strong brands such as 'Amazon', 'Ebay' and
'Etsy', being closely researched and conformed to accordingly.

The **Navigation Bar** will be fixed at the top, with the
**Logo** and **Search Bar** stretched across the centre.
**Product** headers will be displayed underneath and centered.
**Icons** will be used for the **Login**, **Basket** and **Service**
features that will be positioned to the
far right of the **Navigation Bar**.

The main **Home** page will have a bold heading titled "Choose a Category",
with clickable icons/images for the three main categories of 'Pocket Watch',
'Parts' and 'Tools'. These icons/ images should intuitively convey the
Website's aim of selling these types of products.

The placement of imagery and icons, as well as the structure of the
navigation bar and home page, should help horn in and focus users
intuition into buying. The key factor being that the simple,
concise structure will not cause cognitive overload and
distract the main aim of the Website.

Throughout the Website a strong emphasis will be made on
clear imagery of products, ensuring that product layout does
not come across as congested. This will allow users to view and search
products quickly and efficiently. Expedited their desire to
add products to their basket and checkout with little fuss.

Extra features such as links to `About` and `Contact`
will be displayed in the footer of the Web page. This limits the users
attention being drawn to other parts of the Website rather than
shopping. An extra icon for `Basket` will also be displayed, providing
the users plentiful opportunities to follow through with the transaction.

Links to `About`, `Contact` will not however
become obsolete for users navigating through the Website. The
longer users are engaged in the
Website the more likely their trust will grow, leading them to
naturally search and find links to `About`, `Contact`.

### Surface

#### Color Scheme

**Primary/ Secondary Colors:**

White: ![#ffffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+)
`rgb(255, 255, 255, 1)`

Green: ![#badc98](https://via.placeholder.com/15/badc98/000000?text=+)
`rgb(186, 220, 192, 1)`

Orange: ![#dc9523](https://via.placeholder.com/15/dc9523/000000?text=+)
`rgb(220, 149, 35, 1)`

There will be a strong usage of white in the Website. Products will be
displayed over a white background so that they take precedent and catch
the users eye.

The main header will also have a white background that will help the logo
and icon features become apparant and distinct.

A light fresh green will then be used for the Navbar which will display
the product categories. This subtle and less dominant shade of green will
empathise the categories in a friendly, warm manner.

A complimentary orange will then be used to help draw out the important
features of the Website such as the main headers and accumulative costs
under the `basket` icon.

A suggested complimentary colour for
![#badc98](https://via.placeholder.com/15/badc98/000000?text=+)
`rgb(186, 220, 192, 1)` was a light purple. It was decided that
this shade of purple did not suit the theme and user profile of
the Website.

- **Font Colors**

Black: ![#000000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/000000/000000?text=+)
`rgb(0, 0, 0, 1)`

White: ![#ffffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+)
`rgb(255, 255, 255, 1)`

Fonts will be mainly black throughout the website. Black is a prominent
colour that will hold well with clarity against a background white.

White font will be used against non-white colours where appropriate,
to continue the clarity of readability.

- **Button/ Link Colour**

Orange: ![#DC9523](https://via.placeholder.com/15/dc9523/000000?text=+)
`rgb(220, 149, 35, 1)`

Black: ![#000000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/000000/000000?text=+)
`rgb(0, 0, 0, 1)`

White: ![#ffffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+)
`rgb(255, 255, 255, 1)`

Buttons/ Links that have positive actions will be of an orange colour
with white text. This will help the buttons/ links stand out and at
the same time entice a soft approach for users to add products and
move towards checkout

**Buttons/ Links/ Icons/ Hover Affects**
For most hover affects a slight opacity of `0.6` will be used that
will subtly change the tone of the button/ links and inform the user
to click accordingly.

Larger icons in the Headers/ Navbar/ Footer will hover from a black
colour to orange to continue with the main colour theme of the Website.

For **User Login**, **Checkout** and **Confirm Payment** Buttons/Links
will be black with white text and be used to highlight the importance
and seriousness of clicking the link.

- **Body Text/ Input Fields**

- Grey: ![#404040](https://via.placeholder.com/15/404040/000000?text=+)

`rgb(64, 64, 64, 1)`

Body text that provides descriptions of products, as well as order
information, will be of a light grey to provide a softer tone, which
is easier on the eye.

- **Toasts**

Warning: ![#5cb85c](https://via.placeholder.com/15/5cb85c/000000?text=+)
`rgb(92, 184, 92)`

Info: ![#5bc0de](https://via.placeholder.com/15/5bc0de/000000?text=+)
`rgb(91, 192, 222)`

Error: ![#f0ad4e](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f0ad4e/000000?text=+)
`rgb(240, 173, 78)`

Danger: ![#d9534f](https://via.placeholder.com/15/d9534f/000000?text=+)
`rgb(217, 83, 79)`

For Toast info windows, colours conforming to standard pratices will be used
for `Warning`, `Info`. `Error` and `Danger` respectively.

#### Typography

- font-family: 'Berkshire Swash', cursive;

![Berkshire Swash](/documentation/readme/berkshire.png/)

`Bershire Swash` font will be used for the main headers of the
Website. This font really helps bring out the theme and feel of
the Website. Creating an old fashioned feel appropriate for
Pocket Watches.

- font-family:'Roboto', sans-serif;

![Roboto Text](/documentation/readme/roboto.png/)

The complimentary font of `Roboto` will be used for the main
content of the Website.

**N.B.** It should be noted that through the design process
there have been necessary changes made to the Website and
therefore to the Wireframes. The overall structure and layout
of the Website remains the same but it was decided to change
the colour theme of the website along with an app change.

The original colour theme, of contrasting greys, was not
satisfactory to the overall feel of the Website. As it created
a very bland and dull user interface. It was therefore replaced
with a more engaging colour theme explained in the **Surface**
section.

The Forum app was also replaced with a Service app. It was
felt that a 'Repair or Valuation' service booking form was
more beneficial for both the user and owner, as it would
potentially create extra business and profit for Grandpa's
Pocket Watch Shop.

## Features

---

### Navigation Bar/ Main Header

- **Mobile**

![Nav-Mobile](/documentation/readme/nav-mobile.png/)

For mobile devices the Navigation Bar/ Header will focus more
on intuitive icons to click rather than text, to ensure a
minimalistic and non-congestive look.

The main header will include the logo that is clickable to the
Home page, along with the three icons for `Repair & Valuation`,
`Profile` and `Basket`. Each icon, when hovered over, will change
colour to orange `rgb(220, 149, 35, 1)`.

For the basket icon a total figure will be displayed directly
underneath. When products are added to the basket the number
will change from black to orange `rgb(220, 149, 35, 1)`
and show the accumulative sum of products(s) added. This is a
subtle feature that will catch the users eye while they are
shopping. and perhaps even encourage users to follow through
with their transaction.

Under the main header a toggle icon will be displayed that once
clicked will create a dropdown menu of all categories and the
products associated with them.

A search bar will continually be present and accessible on
all devices to inform the user that due to the extensive number
of products the searches function is available to help in the
user experience. The search function will allow for searches
in name fileds as well as in description fields.

- **Desktop**

![Nav-Desktop](/documentation/readme/nav-desktop.png/)

For larger devices the features displayed and their
functionality will mainly remain the same except that the
category names will be displayed - `Pocket Watches`, `Parts``
and `Tools` - and when clicked a dropdown menu will display
all products within that category.

The search bar will move to the main header and displayed
centrally between the logo and icons.

Media queries are set up for icons and headings to
decrease in size for smaller devices to ensure the desktop
layout is maintained, until the Bootstrap Navbar Collapse
kicks in for mobile devices.

The Naiviagtion/ Main Header layout will remain constant
throughout the navigation through the Website. Allowing
the user to become familiar very quickly with the
Website navigation.

### Home Page

- **Mobile**

![Home Mobile](/documentation/readme/home-mb.png/)

The `Home` page for mobile devices will be kept simple and
minimalistic to draw the user to the three main icons of
categories to choose, steeredthat will be drawn to after
reading page header, 'Choose a Category'. The icons once
hovered over will enlarge and be intuitively clickable.

- **Desktop**

![Home Desktop](/documentation/readme/home-dt.png/)

The `Home` page for larger devices will keep the same design
format, but instead have images of the categories, that
when hovered over, will disappear and display the category
name in its place. This extra feature brings a greater visual
and interactive experience to the user.

### Products App

![Products](/documentation/readme/products.png/)

The `Products` page will display products unified in size and
layed out symetrically in 4 columns for large screens and
decreasing to 3, 2 and 1 column as the screen sizes reduce.
This ensures the products are clearly viewed and not rendered
too small on any device screen size.

Each product will have their 'Name', 'Cost' and 'Sku Number'
displayed underneath. A large orange button, with the text
'ADD TO BASKET' is viewable to the user and spans the length
of the product image width. When hovered over the button
enlarges slightly and turns a darker shade of orange. 
This allows the user skip the option to seek further details
of the product continue shopping.

There are of course options for the user to seek more
information on a product enabled through
cicking on the information icon or hovering over the
image itself, which in turn will redirect the user to
the `Product Details` page. Here the product will be 
displayed soley on it's own, with a larger image and
more descriptive text.

A button for 'ADD TO BASKET' is also displayed on the 
`Product Details` page along with another
link to enable the user to `Keep Shopping`.

The goal of the Website is to always encourage a user
to purchase products in a friendly manner yet provide
alternative navigation options.

Once the 'ADD TO BASKET' button is clicked an info window
will pop up with a notification of the product added. 
Defensive design prevents the users from adding the 
same product twice and will be notified accordingly 
by a pop up window.

### Basket App

![Basket](/documentation/readme/basket.png/)

The `Basket` page will display an accumulative list of
products added to the basket that will include their 'Image',
'Product Name' and 'Sku Number'. Each product in the basket
will have a delete icon along side it, that is black in colour
and red when hovered over. The delete icon will remove the 
product item from the basket and recalculate costs.

For desktop devices there will be a two column structure,
the first showing a list of items in the basket and the second
showing the 'Item(s)Total', 'Delivery' and 'Total Cost'. As the 
basket list expands the second column of totals will remian
viewable.

Underneath the totals summary there will be a button to click to
'CHECKOUT', which will take a background colour
of black with white font to highlight it's importance.
The user will also have the option to 'Keep Shopping',
keeping to the trend of providing the user options.

For smaller devices the information will be displayed
as a single column with a list of products in basket
being displayed first and then the 'Totals' and 'Checkout'
icon after.

### Checkout App

![Checkout](/documentation/readme/checkout.png/)

The `Checkout` page will have a simlar layout as the
`Basket` page except the delete icon will not be
available and there will be delivery information
fields to fill out for payment.

For the payment form each field will have a placeholder
text defining which inputs are required and which are
optional with the use of an astrex. For registered users
the fields will autmatically be prefilled if the user
has updates thier profile.

Defensive design will prevent any form from being
submitted and notifications will continally advise the
user of any issues while completing the
the payment form.

A `COMPLETE ORDER` button is displayed at the end of the 
payment form along with a secure icon dislayed to
highlight it's securty. If all infomraiton is completed
and the user confirms order, a spinner window of
green, matching the colour theme of the website, will
be displayed until the payment order goes through on
Stripe. After which an info window will pop up
comnfirming the order has gone through. The user
will then be redirected to an order summary page
that will provide all the details of their order.
An email will also be sent to their email address
confirming these details.

It should be noted that while on the `Checkout` page
there is an option and link for the user to `Adjust`
their basket.

### Services App

![Services](/documentation/readme/services.png/)

The `Service` page can only be accessed if you are a
registered user and non users will be advised to register
before hand.

The `Service` will have a 2 column design for desktop and
1 column for mobile.

The main header of the page will invite the user to visit
the shop, which will then be followed by the proposal for
the user to have their Pocket Watch repaired or valued,
which will be an exciting oportunity for any user visting
the Website.

Icons are used to describe the Repair or Valuation offers,
under which details of the service provided will be shown.

An image of a man fixing a watch brings the page to
life with a caption below stating the day and time
appointments can be booked.

A flashing arrow pointing towards the appointment form
will direct the user accordingly.

All fields of the form are required and necessary alerts
will advise the user when fields are not filled in correctly. 
Dropdown options are used where possible to make the form
as easy to fill out as possible and also minimaises
input errors.

For the date field a date picker calender pops up allowing
for the user to pick a date without having to type
a date manually. This also prevents field errors when dates
can take different formats.

A bold, 'CONFIRM APPOINTMENT' button is displayed at
the bottom of the colour orange and once clicked the
user will be redirected to a confimation booking page.
A notification info window will also pop up confirming
the appointment.

ALong with this an email of the appointment booking will
be sent to the users email with all details provided. 

On the confirmation booking page a 'BACK TO MY PROFILE'
button will be displayed which will redirect them to their
`My Profile` page informing the user of their appointment
booking which they are able to remove or edit.

For smaller devices the 2 columns will collapse
into one column with the appointment form positioned at
the bottom.

### Extra Features

Only login/ conyact if registered

Toast delay

Stripe
Then we'll use an elegant UI feature of stripe called
elements to add a secure form element for collecting
credit card information.

So our form is being submitted and orders are successfully
created in the database. But what happens if the users
somehow intentionally or accidentally closes the browser
window after the payment is confirmed but before the form
is submitted. We would end up with a payment in stripe but
no order in our database. What's more, if we were building
a real store that needed to complete post order operations
like fulfilment sending internal email notifications and
so on none of that stuff would be triggered because the
user never fully completed their order. This could result
in a customer being charged and never receiving a confirmation
email or even worse never receiving what they ordered.
To prevent this situation we're going to build in some
redundancy. Each time an event occurs on stripe such as a
payment intent being created. A payment being completed and
so on stripe sends out what's called a webhook we can listen
for. Webhooks are like the signals django sends each time a
model is saved or deleted. Except that they're sent securely
from stripe to a URL we specify.

## Credits

---

### Code

- Grandpa's Pocket Watch Shop Website was influenced and inspired by the
  Boutique Ado lessons tutored by @ckz8780 at
  [code Institute](https://courses.codeinstitute.net/program/FullstackWebDeveloper)
  , especially concepts and frameworks behind e-commerse Websites
  and the features available. Grandpa's Pocket Watch Shop however
  was customised accordingly to fit the Website's aim as well as
  modified and extended to create new feaures and apps tailored
  towards the Websites requirements.

- The Image Overlay feature for the `Home` pages icons was inspired by
  [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_image_overlay_opacity).

- The contact form was guided by a tutorial at
  [Learn Django](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-email-contact-form).

- Support to fix the Date Picker selecting only certain date periods was taken from
  [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34063300/enable-only-current-week-days-in-bootstrap-datepicker)

- The blinking icon feature in the Services app was taken from an idea provided by
  [HTML Online](https://html-online.com/articles/blinking-text-css-animation/).
