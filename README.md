# Grandpa's Pocket Watch Shop

---

Pocket Watches can be traced back to Italy in the late 15th
century, with manufacture spreading throughout the rest of
Europe in the early part of the 16th century. They were
the most common type of watch until around 1914 when wrist
watches started to come into fashion.

Although their professional usage in the modern environment
has come to an end they still hold a lot of value and
attraction for enthusiasts who enjoy both the pleasure of
owning a pocket watch and fixing and refurbishing
one.

Although a niche market **Pocket Watches**,
**Parts** and **Tools** are highly sought after and
highly valued. However, such intricate parts can be very
difficult to come by and find, which is why a website is
a perfect platform to fill this gap in the market place.

The aim of this Website is to provide an outlet for
**Pocket Watches**, **Parts** and **Tools**, to fill the gap
in the market of a modern e-commerce Website that paves the way
for a smooth, easy and friendly place for consumers to search,
view and purchase **Pocket Watches**, **Parts** and **Tools**.

## UX

---

### Strategy

Users of this Website are a specific group of pocket
watch enthusiasts who often have a high level of knowledge
with particular pocket watch requirements and needs. The Website
therefore must be fully researched and accurately
describe it's products.

Users of e-commerce Websites aim to be able to quickly
navigate to the product they require with
ease, intuition, and limited complications. Adding a
'Search' feature to the Website will increase users ability
to find products quickly.

The Website needs to stand out from it's competitors by being
rich in imagery and specific in product details. Creating a repair
and valuation service for registered users only will increase user
loyalty to the Website and encourage them to return.

A mobile first approach will be instigated in the design
to allow users to purchase easily and efficiently on smaller
devices.

For this Website an 'Agile User Stories' list will
continually be assessed and achieved to ensure the greatest
experience and satisfaction for users.

Agile User Stories can be found
[here](https://github.com/Bealby/grandpas-pocket-watch-shop/blob/master/documentation/readme/user-stories.pdf)

### Scope

The Website needs to allow users to add products to their
basket on a continuous basis while shopping and browsing
through the Website. As their last task needs to be to
follow through to the checkout and payment, while being
notified of each step along the way.

The Website also needs to allow it's 'superusers' to
create, edit and delete products to accurately maintain
details and expand the Website's product portfolio.

A contact information page allows users to report back
any issues, particularly enquiries regarding products
and purchases. The repair and valuation service
will also be included.

### Structure

As an e-commerce enterprise that sells products, the
Website needs to reflect this visibly upon entering
the Website, so that users know exactly why they are 'there',
and what they can immediately 'do'.

To achieve this goal, e-commerce design conventions used by
strong brands such as 'Amazon', 'Ebay' and
'Etsy', need to be applied. This was done.

The **Navigation Bar** will be fixed at the top, with the
**Logo** and **Search Bar** stretched across the centre.
**Product** headers will be displayed underneath and centered.
**Icons** will be used for the **Login**, **Basket** and **Service**
features that will be positioned to the
far right of the **Navigation Bar**.

The main **Home** page will have a bold heading titled "Choose a Category",
with clickable icons/images for the three main categories of 'Pocket Watch',
'Parts' and 'Tools'. These icons/ images should intuitively convey the
Website's aim of selling these types of products.

The placement of imagery and icons, as well as the structure of the
navigation bar and home page, should help hone in and focus users
intuition into buying. The key factor to be aware of is that the simple,
concise structure will avoid cognitive overload and
distract the main aim of the Website.

Throughout the Website a strong emphasis will be made on
clear imagery of products, ensuring that product layout does
not come across as congested. This will allow users to view and search
products quickly and efficiently, and so expedite their desire to
add products to their basket and checkout with little fuss.

Extra features such as links to `About` and `Contact`
will be displayed in the footer of the Web page. This limits the users
attention being drawn to other parts of the Website rather than
shopping. An extra icon for `Basket` will also be displayed, providing
the users plentiful opportunities to follow through with the transaction.

Links to `About`, `Contact` will not however
become obsolete for users navigating through the Website. The
longer users are engaged in the
Website the more likely their trust will grow, leading them to
naturally search and find links to `About`, `Contact`.

### Skeleton

Please find my Wireframes for Desktop, Tablet and Mobile
[here](https://github.com/Bealby/grandpas-pocket-watch-shop/blob/master/documentation/wireframes/wireframes.pdf)

### Surface

#### Colour Scheme

**Primary/ Secondary Colours:**

White: ![#ffffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+)
`rgb(255, 255, 255, 1)`

Green: ![#badc98](https://via.placeholder.com/15/badc98/000000?text=+)
`rgb(186, 220, 192, 1)`

Orange: ![#dc9523](https://via.placeholder.com/15/dc9523/000000?text=+)
`rgb(220, 149, 35, 1)`

There will be a strong usage of white in the Website. Products will be
displayed over a white background so that they take precedent and catch
the users eye.

The main header will also have a white background that will help the logo
and icon features become apparent and distinct.

A light fresh green will then be used for the Navbar which will display
the product categories. This subtle and less dominant shade of green will
empathise the categories in a friendly, warm manner.

A complimentary orange will then be used to help draw out the important
features of the Website such as the main headers and accumulative costs
under the `basket` icon.

A suggested complimentary colour for
![#badc98](https://via.placeholder.com/15/badc98/000000?text=+)
`rgb(186, 220, 192, 1)` was a light purple. It was decided that
this shade of purple did not suit the theme and user profile of
the Website.

- **Font Colours**

Black: ![#000000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/000000/000000?text=+)
`rgb(0, 0, 0, 1)`

White: ![#ffffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+)
`rgb(255, 255, 255, 1)`

Fonts will be mainly black throughout the website. Black is a prominent
colour that will hold well with clarity against a background white.

White font will be used against non-white colours where appropriate,
to continue the clarity of readability.

- **Button/ Link Colour**

Orange: ![#DC9523](https://via.placeholder.com/15/dc9523/000000?text=+)
`rgb(220, 149, 35, 1)`

Black: ![#000000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/000000/000000?text=+)
`rgb(0, 0, 0, 1)`

White: ![#ffffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+)
`rgb(255, 255, 255, 1)`

Buttons/ Links that have positive actions will be of an orange colour
with white text. This will help the buttons/ links stand out and at
the same time entice a soft approach for users to add products and
move towards checkout

**Buttons/ Links/ Icons/ Hover Affects**
For most hover affects a slight opacity of `0.6` will be used that
will subtly change the tone of the button/ links and inform the user
to click accordingly.

Larger icons in the Headers/ Navbar/ Footer will hover from a black
colour to orange to continue with the main colour theme of the Website.

For **User Login**, **Checkout** and **Confirm Payment** Buttons/Links
will be black with white text and be used to highlight the importance
and seriousness of clicking the link.

- **Body Text/ Input Fields**

- Grey: ![#404040](https://via.placeholder.com/15/404040/000000?text=+)

`rgb(64, 64, 64, 1)`

Body text that provides descriptions of products, as well as order
information, will be of a light grey to provide a softer tone, which
is easier on the eye.

- **Toasts**

Warning: ![#5cb85c](https://via.placeholder.com/15/5cb85c/000000?text=+)
`rgb(92, 184, 92)`

Info: ![#5bc0de](https://via.placeholder.com/15/5bc0de/000000?text=+)
`rgb(91, 192, 222)`

Error: ![#f0ad4e](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f0ad4e/000000?text=+)
`rgb(240, 173, 78)`

Danger: ![#d9534f](https://via.placeholder.com/15/d9534f/000000?text=+)
`rgb(217, 83, 79)`

For Toast info windows, colours conforming to standard practices will be used
for `Warning`, `Info`. `Error` and `Danger` respectively.

#### Typography

- font-family: 'Berkshire Swash', cursive;

![Berkshire Swash](/documentation/readme/berkshire.png/)

`Bershire Swash` font will be used for the main headers of the
Website. This font really helps bring out the theme and feel of
the Website. Creating an old fashioned feel appropriate for
Pocket Watches.

- font-family:'Roboto', sans-serif;

![Roboto Text](/documentation/readme/roboto.png/)

The complimentary font of `Roboto` will be used for the main
content of the Website.

**N.B.** It should be noted that through the design process
there have been necessary changes made to the Website and
therefore to the Wireframes. The overall structure and layout
of the Website remains the same but it was decided to change
the colour theme of the website along with an app change.

The original colour theme, of contrasting greys, was not
satisfactory to the overall feel of the Website. As it created
a very bland and dull user interface. It was therefore replaced
with a more engaging colour theme explained in the **Surface**
section.

The Forum app was also replaced with a Service app. It was
felt that a 'Repair or Valuation' service booking form was
more beneficial for both the user and owner, as it would
potentially create extra business and profit for Grandpa's
Pocket Watch Shop.

## Features

---

### Navigation Bar/ Main Header

**Mobile**

![Nav-Mobile](/documentation/readme/nav-mobile.png/)

- For mobile devices the Navigation Bar/ Header will focus more
  on intuitive icons to click rather than text, to ensure a
  minimalistic and non-congestive look.

- The main header will include the logo that is clickable to the
  `Home` page, along with the three icons for `Repair & Valuation`,
  `Profile` and `Basket`. Each icon, when hovered over, will change
  colour to orange `rgb(220, 149, 35, 1)`.

- For the basket icon a total figure will be displayed directly
  underneath. When products are added to the basket the number
  will change from black to orange `rgb(220, 149, 35, 1)`
  and show the accumulative sum of products(s) added. This is a
  subtle feature that will catch the users eye while they are
  shopping. and perhaps even encourage users to follow through
  with their transaction.

- Under the main header a toggle icon will be displayed that once
  clicked will create a dropdown menu of all categories and the
  products associated with them.

- A search bar will continually be present and accessible on
  all device size screens to inform the user that there is support
  in searching through the extensive number of products listed.
  The search function will allow for searches
  in name fields as well as in description fields.

**Desktop**

![Nav-Desktop](/documentation/readme/nav-desktop.png/)

- For larger devices the features displayed and their
  functionality will mainly remain the same except that the
  category names will be displayed - `Pocket Watches`, `Parts`
  and `Tools` - and when clicked a dropdown menu will display
  all products within that category.

- The search bar will move to the main header and displayed
  centrally between the logo and icons.

- Media queries are set up for icons and headings to
  decrease in size for smaller devices to ensure the desktop
  layout is maintained, until the Bootstrap Navbar Collapse
  kicks in for mobile devices.

- The Navigation/ Main Header layout will remain constant
  throughout the navigation through the Website. Allowing
  the user to become familiar very quickly with the
  Website navigation.

### Home Page

![Home Desktop](/documentation/readme/home-dt.png/)

- The `Home` page will display 4 images of categories that
  when hovered over will display the category names `Watches`,
  `Parts`, `Tools` and `Services` respectively. All of which
  are links that once clicked will navigate the user to the
  relevant pages accordingly.

- The image feature brings a greater visual
  and interactive experience to the user.
  
- It was chosen to use the title 'Grandpa's Pocket Watch
  Shop' to first of all establish the specific nature of
  products being sold, whihc are solely revolved around
  Pocket Watches.
  
- A sub header, Choose a Category`, is then displayed to
  inform the users of the categories available to explore.

- The layout will be of for columns of images on one row
  on dektop and medium devices, and be reduced to on column
  for mobile. 

### Products App

![Products](/documentation/readme/products.png/)

- The `Products` page will display products unified in size and
  laid out symmetrically in 4 columns for large screens and
  decreasing to 3, 2 and 1 column as the screen sizes reduce.
  This ensures the products are clearly viewed and not rendered
  too small on any device screen size.

- Each product will have their 'Name', 'Cost' and 'Sku Number'
  displayed underneath. A large orange button, with the text
  'ADD TO BASKET' is viewable to the user and spans the length
  of the product image width. When hovered over the button
  enlarges slightly and turns a darker shade of orange. 
  This allows the user to skip the option to seek further details
  of the product if they prefer to quickly continue shopping.

- There are of course options for the user to seek more
  information on a product enabled through
  clicking on the information icon or hovering over the
  image itself, which in turn will redirect the user to
  the `Product Details` page. Here the product will be 
  displayed solely on it's own, with a larger image and
  more descriptive text.

- A button for 'ADD TO BASKET' is also displayed on the 
  `Product Details` page along with another
  link to enable the user to `Keep Shopping`.

- The goal of the Website is to always encourage a user
  to purchase products in a friendly manner yet provide
  alternative navigation options.

- Once the 'ADD TO BASKET' button is clicked an info window
  will pop up with a notification of the product added. 
  Defensive design prevents the users from adding the 
  same product twice and will be notified accordingly 
  by a pop up window.

### Basket App

![Basket](/documentation/readme/basket.png/)

- The `Basket` page will display an accumulative list of
  products added to the basket that will include their 'Image',
  'Product Name' and 'Sku Number'. Each product in the basket
  will have a delete icon along side it, that is black in colour
  and red when hovered over. The delete icon will remove the 
  product item from the basket and recalculate costs.

- For desktop devices there will be a two column structure,
  the first showing a list of items in the basket and the second
  showing the 'Item(s)Total', 'Delivery' and 'Total Cost'. As the 
  basket list expands the second column of totals will remain
  viewable.

-  Underneath the totals summary there will be a button to click to
  'CHECKOUT', which will take a background colour
  of black with white font to highlight it's importance.
  The user will also have the option to 'Keep Shopping',
  providing the user alternative options.

- For smaller devices the information will be displayed
  in a single column with the list of products in basket
  being displayed first and then the 'Totals' and 'Checkout'
  icons after.

### Checkout App

![Checkout](/documentation/readme/checkout.png/)

- The `Checkout` page will have a similar layout as the
  `Basket` page except the delete icon will not be
  available and there will be delivery information
  fields to fill out for payment.

- For the payment form each field will have a placeholder
  text defining which inputs are required and which are
  optional with the use of an asterisk. For registered users
  the fields will automatically be prefilled if the user
  has updated their profile.

- Defensive design will prevent any form from being
  submitted and notifications will continually advise the
  user of any issues while completing the
  the payment form.

- A `COMPLETE ORDER` button is displayed at the end of the 
  payment form along with a secure icon to
  highlight it's security. If all information is completed,
  and the user confirms the order, a spinner window of
  green, matching the colour theme of the website, will
  be displayed until the payment order goes through on
  Stripe. After which an info window will pop up
  confirming the order has gone through. The user
  will then be redirected to an order summary page
  that will provide all the details of their order.
  An email will also be sent to their email address
  confirming these details.

- It should be noted that while on the `Checkout` page
  there is an option and link for the user to `Adjust`
  their basket.

### Services App

![Services](/documentation/readme/services.png/)

-  The `Service` page can only be accessed if you are a
  registered user and non users will be advised to register
  before hand.

- The `Service` will have a 2 column design for desktop and 
  1 column for mobile.

- The main header of the page will invite the user to visit
  the shop, which will then be followed by the proposal for
  the user to have their Pocket Watch repaired or valued,
  which will be an exciting opportunity for any user visiting
  the Website.

- Icons are used to describe the Repair or Valuation offers,
  under which details of the service provided will be shown.

- An image of a man fixing a watch brings the page to
  life with a caption below stating the day and time
  appointments can be booked.

- A flashing arrow pointing towards the appointment form
  will direct the user accordingly.

- All fields of the form are required and necessary alerts
  will advise the user when fields are not filled in correctly. 
  Dropdown options are used where possible to make the form
  as easy to fill out as possible and also minimise
  input errors.

- For the date field a date picker calendar pops up allowing
  for the user to pick a date without having to type
  a date manually. This also prevents field errors when dates
  can take different formats.

- A bold, 'CONFIRM APPOINTMENT' button is displayed at
  the bottom of the colour orange and once clicked the
  user will be redirected to a confirmation booking page.
  A notification info window will also pop up confirming
  the appointment.

- Along with this an email of the appointment booking will
  be sent to the users email with all details provided. 

- On the confirmation booking page a 'BACK TO MY PROFILE'
  button will be displayed which will redirect them to their
  `My Profile` page informing the user of their appointment
  bookings which they are able to remove or edit.

- For smaller devices the 2 columns will collapse
  into one column with the appointment form positioned at
  the bottom.

### Contact App

![Contact](/documentation/readme/contact.png/)

- A `Contact` page provides the user with the opportunity
  to get in contact with the owners with any order or
  general enquiry questions.
  
- For the desktop the `Contact` page will have a 2 column
  design. The first column will display the address, email
  telephone information. Icons are used for better UI. 
  
- Below the contact information there will be an interactive
  map, set up through google, that will provide the shop location
  along with a pop up information window which will bring up the shop's
  logo as well as opening and closing times.

- The contact form itself has three required fields and users will
  be prompted for each field filled in incorrectly. Icons are used
  in the contact form to highlight the send functionalities for better
  UI.

- Once an email is submitted the user is redirected to a success page
  and an info window pops up to confirm that the email is sent. 

- A 'Keep Shopping' link is also provided in the success page to enable
  users to navigate away from the contact page.
 
- For smaller devices the 2 column layout will be
  reduced to 1 column with the contact details and map
  first and contact form displayed after.

### About App

![About](/documentation/readme/about.png/)

- An `About` page will give the user a little insight into
  Grandpa's Pocket Watch Shop. Providing information on 
  it's history and giving the user a personal connection
  to the Website.

### Profile App

![Profile](/documentation/readme/profile.png/)

- The `My Profile` page is an important part of the
  Website for authenticated users. 

- Here users are able to view past orders and up and
  coming appointments booked. 

- Past order information can be viewed on a separate page to
  allow the user to double check any details in an order and
  make enquiries if so required. 

- Appointments can be edited or removed with icons used for each
  respectively. When an appointment booking is removed
  a pop up notification will be displayed accordingly.

- If a user decides to edit an appointment they will be redirected
  to an edit appointment page where previous details will be defaulted on
  the form. Any changes made will then be confirmed and a new updated
  appointment form sent to their email.

- Order and Appointments are displayed in the second column of
  the page and at a certain break point information turns
  to a scrolling window which prevents the page from becoming
  too congested with order and appointment information.

- In the first column of the page the delivery information is
  shown. Once these fields are filled in correctly they will be used
  as default field content for the payment form. Reducing the users
  work load. 

- For smaller devices the order and appointment field information
  is reduced to allow for better viewing on smaller devices.

### Extra Features

- `Allauth` was used for the profile and accounts functionality, which
  includes features such as Login, Password Reset. All `Alluath` pages 
  will have a standard format of layout and font. With black icons and
  white text.

- Toast info windows are set up throughout the Website to help notify
  the user upon any successes, information, warnings and error messages.
  The info toast windows are set with a 15000 time delay after which they will 
  disappear if not removed by the user manually.

- `Stripe` functionality is used for the payment procedure which
   adds a secure form element for collecting credit card information.
   `Webhooks` are also used to listen for any unprecedented, unusual
   behaviour which could affect the payment process. They will send
   out signals each time a model is saved or deleted, sent
   securely from Stripe to a URL.

- `Users` will be encouraged to registor on the Website to be able to save
   delivery information, book appointments, and store confirmaiton
   bookings on a personal profile page.

## Credits

---

### Code

- Grandpa's Pocket Watch Shop Website was influenced and inspired by the
  Boutique Ado lessons tutored by @ckz8780 at
  [code Institute](https://courses.codeinstitute.net/program/FullstackWebDeveloper)
  , especially concepts and frameworks behind e-commerce Websites
  and the features available. Grandpa's Pocket Watch Shop however
  was customised accordingly to fit the Website's aim as well as
  modified and extended to create new features and apps tailored
  towards the Websites requirements.

- The Image Overlay feature for the `Home` pages icons was inspired by
  [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_image_overlay_opacity).

- The contact form was guided by a tutorial at
  [Learn Django](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-email-contact-form).

- Support to fix the Date Picker selecting only certain date periods was taken from
  [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34063300/enable-only-current-week-days-in-bootstrap-datepicker)

  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/153759/jquery-datepicker-with-text-input-that-doesnt-allow-user-input#153804

- The blinking icon feature in the Services app was taken from an idea provided by
  [HTML Online](https://html-online.com/articles/blinking-text-css-animation/).
