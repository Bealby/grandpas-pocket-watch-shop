# Grandpa's Pocket Watch Shop

---

Pocket Watches can be traced back to the late 15th century
in Italy, with manufacture spreading throughout the rest of
Europe in the early part of the 16th century. They were
the most common type of watch until around 1914 when wrist
watches started to come into fashion.

Although their professional usage in the modern environment
has come to an end they still hold a lot of value and
attraction for enthusiasts who enjoy both the pleasure of
owning a pocket watch and fixing and refurbishing
one.

Although a niche market the value of **Pocket Watches**,
**Parts** and **Tools** can be highly sought after and
highly valued. However, such intricate parts can be very
difficult to come by and find, which is why a website is
a perfect platform to fill this gap in the market place.

The aim of this Website is to provide an outlet for
**Pocket Watches**, **Parts** and **Tools**. To fill the gap
in the market of a modern e-commerce Website that paves the way
for a smooth, easy and friendly place for consumers to search,
view and purchase **Pocket Watches**, **Parts** and **Tools**.

## UX

---

### Strategy

Users of this Website are a specific group of pocket
watch enthusiasts who often have a high level of knowledge
with particular pocket watch requirements and needs. The Website
therefore needs to be fully researched and accurately
describe it's products.

For most e-commerce Websites the aims of the user is to
be able to quickly navigate to the product they require with
ease, intuition, and limited complications. Adding a
'Search' feature to the Website will increase users ability
to find products in a quicker way.

The Website needs to stand out from it's competitors by being
rich in imagery and specific in product details. Creating a repair
or valuation service for registered users only will increase user
loyalty to the Website and encourage them to return.

A mobile first approach will be instigated in the design
to allow users to purchase easily and efficiently on smaller
devices.

For this Website an 'Agile User Stories' list will
continually be assessed and achieved to ensure the greatest
experience and satisfaction for users.

Agile User Stories can be found
[here](https://github.com/Bealby/grandpas-pocket-watch-shop/blob/master/documentation/readme/user-stories.pdf)

### Scope

The Website needs to allow users to add products to their
basket on a continuous basis while shopping and perusing through
the Website. To penultimately follow through to the checkout
and payment, while being notified of each step along the way.

The Website also needs to allow it's 'superusers' to create, edit
and delete products to accurately maintain details and expand the
Website's product portfolio.

A contact information page to allow users to make enquiries
regarding products and purchases will also be provided.
Along with a repair and valuation service,

### Structure

As an e-commerce enterprise that sells products, the
Website needs to reflect this visibly upon entering
the Website, so that users know exactly why they are 'there',
and what they can immediately 'do'.

To achieve this goal, e-commerce design conventions need
to be applied, with strong brands such as 'Amazon', 'Ebay' and
'Etsy', being closely researched and conformed to accordingly.

The **Navigation Bar** will be fixed at the top, with the
**Logo** and **Search Bar** stretched across the centre.
**Product** headers will be displayed underneath and centered.
**Icons** will be used for the **Login**, **Basket** and **Service**
features that will be positioned to the
far right of the **Navigation Bar**.

The main **Home** page will have a bold heading titled "Choose a Category",
with clickable icons/images for the three main categories of 'Pocket Watch',
'Parts' and 'Tools'. These icons/ images should intuitively convey the
Website's aim of selling these types of products.

The placement of imagery and icons, as well as the structure of the
navigation bar and home page, should help horn in and focus users
intuition into buying. The key factor being that the simple,
concise structure will not cause cognitive overload and
distract the main aim of the Website.

Throughout the Website a strong emphasis will be made on
clear imagery of products, ensuring that product layout does
not come across as congested. This will allow users to view and search
products quickly and efficiently. Expedited their desire to
add products to their basket and checkout with little fuss.

Extra features such as links to `About` and `Contact`
will be displayed in the footer of the Web page. This limits the users
attention being drawn to other parts of the Website rather than
shopping. An extra icon for `Basket` will also be displayed, providing
the users plentiful opportunities to follow through with the transaction.

Links to `About`, `Contact` will not however
become obsolete for users navigating through the Website. The
longer users are engaged in the
Website the more likely their trust will grow, leading them to
naturally search and find links to `About`, `Contact`.

[here](https://github.com/Bealby/grandpas-pocket-watch-shop/blob/master/documentation/wireframes/wireframes.pdf)

### Surface

#### Color Scheme

**Primary/ Secondary Colors:**

White: ![#ffffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+)
`rgb(255, 255, 255, 1)`

Green: ![#badc98](https://via.placeholder.com/15/badc98/000000?text=+)
`rgb(186, 220, 192, 1)`

Orange: ![#dc9523](https://via.placeholder.com/15/dc9523/000000?text=+)
`rgb(220, 149, 35, 1)`

There will be a strong usage of white in the Website. Products will be
displayed over a white background so that they take precedent and catch
the users eye.

The main header will also have a white background that will help the logo
and icon features become apparant and distinct.

A light fresh green will then be used for the Navbar which will display
the product categories. This subtle and less dominant shade of green will
empathise the categories in a friendly, warm manner.

A complimentary orange will then be used to help draw out the important
features of the Website such as the main headers and accumulative costs
under the `basket` icon.

A suggested complimentary colour for
![#badc98](https://via.placeholder.com/15/badc98/000000?text=+)
`rgb(186, 220, 192, 1)` was a light purple. It was decided that
this shade of purple did not suit the theme and user profile of
the Website.

**Font Colors**

Black: ![#000000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/000000/000000?text=+)
`rgb(0, 0, 0, 1)`

White: ![#ffffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+)
`rgb(255, 255, 255, 1)`

Fonts will be mainly black throughout the website. Black is a prominent
colour that will hold well with clarity against a background white.

White font will be used against non-white colours where appropriate,
to continue the clarity of readability.

**Button/ Link Colour**

Orange: ![#DC9523](https://via.placeholder.com/15/dc9523/000000?text=+)
`rgb(220, 149, 35, 1)`

Black: ![#000000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/000000/000000?text=+)
`rgb(0, 0, 0, 1)`

White: ![#ffffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+)
`rgb(255, 255, 255, 1)`

Buttons/ Links that have positive actions will be of an orange colour
with white text. This will help the buttons/ links stand out and at
the same time entice a soft approach for users to add products and
move towards checkout

**Buttons/ Links/ Icons/ Hover Affects**
For most hover affects a slight opacity of `0.6` will be used that
will subtly change the tone of the button/ links and inform the user
to click accordingly.

Larger icons in the Headers/ Navbar/ Footer will hover from a black
colour to orange to continue with the main colour theme of the Website.

For **User Login**, **Checkout** and **Confirm Payment** Buttons/Links
will be black with white text and be used to highlight the importance
and seriousness of clicking the link.

**Body Text/ Input Fields**

- Grey: ![#404040](https://via.placeholder.com/15/404040/000000?text=+)

`rgb(64, 64, 64, 1)`

Body text that provides descriptions of products, as well as order
information, will be of a light grey to provide a softer tone, which
is easier on the eye.

**Toasts**

Warning: ![#5cb85c](https://via.placeholder.com/15/5cb85c/000000?text=+)
`rgb(92, 184, 92)`

Info: ![#5bc0de](https://via.placeholder.com/15/5bc0de/000000?text=+)
`rgb(91, 192, 222)`

Error: ![#f0ad4e](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f0ad4e/000000?text=+)
`rgb(240, 173, 78)`

Danger: ![#d9534f](https://via.placeholder.com/15/d9534f/000000?text=+)
`rgb(217, 83, 79)`

For Toast info windows, colours conforming to standard pratices will be used
for `Warning`, `Info`. `Error` and `Danger` respectively.

#### Typography

- font-family: 'Berkshire Swash', cursive;

![Berkshire Swash](/documentation/readme/berkshire.png/)

`Bershire Swash` font will be used for the main headers of the
Website. This font really helps bring out the theme and feel of
the Website. Creating an old fashioned feel appropriate for
Pocket Watches.

- font-family:'Roboto', sans-serif;

![Roboto Text](/documentation/readme/roboto.png/)

The complimentary font of `Roboto` will be used for the main
content of the Website.

**N.B.** It should be noted that through the design process
there have been necessary changes made to the Website and
therefore to the Wireframes. The overall structure and layout
of the Website remains the same but it was decided to change
the colour theme of the website along with an app change.

The original colour theme, of contrasting greys, was not
satisfactory to the overall feel of the Website. As it created
a very bland and dull user interface. It was therefore replaced
with a more engaging colour theme explained in the **Surface**
section.

The Forum app was also replaced with a Service app. It was
felt that a 'Repair or Valuation' service booking form was
more beneficial for both the user and owner, as it would
potentially create extra business and profit for Grandpa's
Pocket Watch Shop.

## Features

---

### Navigation Bar/ Main Header

- **Mobile**

![Nav-Mobile](/documentation/readme/nav-mobile.png/)

For mobile devices the Navigation Bar/ Header will focus more
on intuitive icons to click rather than text, to ensure a
minimalistic and non-congestive look.

The main header will include the logo that is clickable to the
Home page, along with the three icons for `Repair & Valuation`,
`Profile` and `Basket`. Each icon, when hovered over, will change
colour to orange `rgb(220, 149, 35, 1)`.

For the basket icon a total figure will be displayed directly
underneath. When products are added to the basket the number
will change from black to orange `rgb(220, 149, 35, 1)` 
and show the accumulative sum of products(s) added. This is a
subtle feature that will catch the users eye while they are
shopping. and perhaps even encourage users to follow through
with their transaction. 

Under the main header a toggle icon will be displayed that once
clicked will create a dropdown menu of all categories and the 
products associated with them.

A search bar will continually be present and accessible on
all devices to inform the user that due to the extensive number
of products the searches function is available to help in the
user experience. The search function will allow for searches
in name fileds as well as in description fields.

functionality will mainly remain the same except that the
category names will be displayed - `Pocket Watches`, `Parts``
and `Tools` - and when clicked a dropdown menu will display
all products within that category.

The search bar will move to the main header and displayed
centrally between the logo and icons.

Media queries are set up for icons and headings to
decrease in size for smaller devices to ensure the desktop
layout is maintained, until the Bootstrap Navbar Collapse
kicks in for mobile devices.

Website navigation.

manner but always provide the user to move on and continue their navigaiton

that will autmatically appear in Checkout

For smaller devices the order and appoijtnemtn  details reduce to a smaller amount of columns for better
viewing.


### Extra Features



Only login/ conyact if registered

Toast delay


Stripe
Then we'll use an elegant UI feature of stripe called elements
to add a secure form element for collecting credit card information.

So our form is being submitted and orders are successfully created in the database.
But what happens if the users somehow intentionally or accidentally
closes the browser window after the payment is confirmed but before the form is submitted.
We would end up with a payment in stripe but no order in our database.
What's more, if we were building a real store that needed to complete
post order operations like fulfilment sending internal email notifications and so on
none of that stuff would be triggered because the user never fully completed their order.
This could result in a customer being charged and never receiving a confirmation email
or even worse never receiving what they ordered.
To prevent this situation we're going to build in some redundancy.
Each time an event occurs on stripe such as a payment intent being created.
A payment being completed and so on stripe sends out what's called a webhook we can listen for.
Webhooks are like the signals django sends each time a model is saved or deleted.
Except that they're sent securely from stripe to a URL we specify.
